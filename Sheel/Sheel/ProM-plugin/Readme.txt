Please follow the following steps to use the plug-in "sheel.jar ":

1. Put sheel.jar into the "extraLib" folder of the ProM project, and add the path of sheel.jar into the build path (cf. g1.png).

2. Run the ProM project and you can find the "Self-healing event logs" (cf. g2.png).

3. Choose the correct file and start the plug-in, which generates the results (cf. g3.png and g4.png).

4. The repaired log can be exported (cf. g5.png).

Note that you can use the log file in the "demo" as the input to test the SHEEL plug-in as a "helloworld" example.
